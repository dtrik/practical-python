# practical-python
Detached fork of [Practical Python Programming](https://dabeaz-course.github.io/practical-python/) (a course open sourced by [@dabeaz](https://github.com/dabeaz))
I initially forked this but then requested it to be detached because my commits were not getting recorded. This is me working through it. The original README.md has beeen renamed to [README_orig.md](https://github.com/dtrik/practical-python/blob/master/README_orig.md)
